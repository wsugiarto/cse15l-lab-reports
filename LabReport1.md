2. If you are on Windows download [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), but if you are on MAC you can skip this step. Just use the default options when prompted.
3. Once Git is installed or if you are on MAC, follow the instructions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal/50527994#50527994).
4. Once you have selected bash in the terminal you should paste the following `ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`, except you should replace the "cs15lsp23zz" with what your username is.
5. Then it will ask `Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?`. Type **YES**. Then it will ask for your password. **NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT YOU ARE TYPING, BUT YOU ARE ACTUALLY TYPING SO JUST CLICK ENTER WHEN YOU ARE DONE TYPING**
6. Once you press enter you should see something similar to this:
